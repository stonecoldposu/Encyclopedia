  ABSTRACT =	 {In this report we present a variety of model
                  existence theorems for classical higher-order
                  logics. The extend the well-known abstract
                  consistency methods to higher-order logics and
                  pinpoint the contribution of extensionality. The
                  results reported here weaken the saturation
                  precondition needed in earlier model existence
                  theorems, making them appliccable to cut-free
                  higher-order logics. This report reprints the
                  article ``Higher Order Semantics and
                  Extensionality'' under review by the Journal of
                  Symbolic Logic and develops the cut-free extensions
                  in detail.},
