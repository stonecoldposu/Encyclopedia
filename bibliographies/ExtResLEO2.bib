  ABSTRACT =	 {This paper presents two approaches to primitive
                  equality treatment in higher-order (HO) automated
                  theorem proving: a calculus $\EXTPARA$ adapting
                  traditional first-order (FO)
                  paramodulation~\cite{RoWo69} , and a calculus
                  $\EXTRUE$ adapting FO
                  RUE-Resolution~\cite{Digricoli79} to HO logic (based
                  on Church's simply typed
                  $\lambda$-calculus). $\EXTPARA$ and $\EXTRUE$ extend
                  the extensional HO resolution approach
                  $\EXTRES$~\cite{BenKoh:ehor98}. In order to reach
                  Henkin completeness without the need for additional
                  extensionality axioms both calculi employ new,
                  positive extensionality rules analogously to the
                  respective negative ones provided by $\EXTRES$ that
                  operate on unification constraints. As the
                  extensionality rules have an intrinsic and
                  unavoidable difference-reducing character the HO
                  paramodulation approach looses its pure
                  term-rewriting character. On the other hand examples
                  demonstrate that the extensionality rules harmonise
                  rather well with the difference-reducing HO
                  RUE-resolution idea.},

                  respect to Henkin completeness and full
                  extensionality. In particular we focus on Andrews'

                  constrained resolution [Huet72], higher-order

                  resolution [BenzmuellerKohlhase98]. With the help of
                  examples we illustrate the parallels and differences
                  of the extensionality treatment of these approaches
                  and demonstrate that extensional higher-order
                  resolution is the sole approach that can completely
                  avoid additional extensionality axioms.},

abstract = "In this paper, we reexamine the problem of general higher-order unification and develop an approach based on the method of transformations on systems of terms which has its roots in Herbrand's thesis, and which was developed by Martelli and Montanari in the context of first-order unification. This method provides an abstract and mathematically elegant means of analyzing the invariant properties of unification in various settings by providing a clean separation of the logical issues from the specification of procedural information. Our major contribution is three-fold. First, we have extended the Herbrand-Martelli-Montanari method of transformations on systems to higher-order unification and pre-unification; second, we have used this formalism to provide a more direct proof of the completeness of a method for higher-order unification than has previously been available; and, finally, we have shown the completeness of the strategy of eager variable elimination. In addition, this analysis provides another justification of the design of Huet's procedure, and shows how its basic principles work in a more general setting. Finally, it is hoped that this presentation might form a good introduction to higher-order unification for those readers unfamiliar with the field. "
