	% The following environments ("clarifications", "history",
	% "technicalities") are optional. If you do use them,
	% be very concise and objective.
	
	\begin{clarifications}
We follow~\cite{Luo:94}.  
Terms of $\LF$ are of the forms ${\bf Type}, El(A)$, $(x:K)K'$
(dependent product), $[x:K]K'$ (abstraction), $f(k)$, and judgements
of the forms $\Gamma\seq{\bf valid}$ (validity of context),
$\Gamma\seq K{\bf kind}$, $\Gamma\seq k:K$, $\Gamma\seq k=k':K$, $\Gamma\seq K=K'$. 
Rule groups: (1) rules for contexts and assumptions; (2)* equality rules (reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity rules are ommitted); (3)** substitution rules ($J$ denotes the right side of any of the five forms of judgement); (4) rules for dependent product kinds; (5) and the kind {\bf Type}. 
	\end{clarifications}
	
	\begin{history}
The calculus was defined in~\cite{Luo:94}, ch. 9. LF is a typed version of Martin-L\"of's logical framework~\cite{NPS:90}\irefmissing{Martin-L\"of's LF}. Type theories specified in $\LF$ were used as basis of proof-assistants Lego and Plastic. Later
the system was extended to include coercive subtyping~\cite{SolLuo:02,
LuoSolXue:14}\irefmissing{LF with coercive subtyping}.
	% ToDo: write here short historical remarks about this proof system,
	% especially if they relate to other proof systems.
	% Use "\iref{OtherProofSystem}" to refer to another proof system
	% in the Encyclopedia (where "OtherProofSystem" is its ID).
	% Use "\irefmissing{SuggestedIDForOtherProofSystem}" to refer to
	% another proof system that is not yet available in the encyclopedia.
	 \end{history}
	
	\begin{technicalities}
	The proof-theoretical analysis of LF above was used in meta-theoretical studies of larger theories defined on its basis, {\em e.g.}, UTT (Universal Type Theory) that includes inductive schemata, second order logic SOL with impredicative type $Prop$ and a hierarchy of predicative universes~\cite{Luo:94}. H. Goguen defined a typed operational
semantics for UTT and proved strong normalization theorem~\cite{HG:94}. For $\LF$
with coercive subtyping conservativity results were obtained~\cite{SolLuo:02,
LuoSolXue:14}.

	% Please cite the original paper where the proof system was defined.
	% To do so, you may use the \cite command within
	% one of the optional environments above,
	% or use the \nocite command otherwise.
	
	% You may also cite a modern paper or book where the
	% proof system is explained in greater depth or clarity.
	% Cite parsimoniously.
	
	% Do not cite related work. Instead, use the "\iref" or "\irefmissing"
	% commands to make an internal reference to another entry,
	% as explained within the "history" environment above.
	
	% You do not need to create the "References" section yourself.
